This code is used to check if the a given string consists of pairs of balanced brackets.
If a string consists of opening and closing characters of brackets like (curly braces - “{“,”}”, parentheses ”(“,”)”, square brackets”[“,”]”. 

Run the matching_brackets.py file using the command “python matching_brackets.py” 

It requires the brackets.txt as input file and then it creates the output file "brackets-matched.txt" in your current working directory.
I have also included output file "brackets-matched.txt" in the zip file.
